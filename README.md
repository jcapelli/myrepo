# Changes to my Projects 
For Project 1, I made comments regarding oberservations of my clean data. 
For Project 2,  I created my MANOVA test again in order to show the signficant difference. The MANOVA test produced a significant result. Therefore each numeric outcome variable should be tested with ANOVA. We performed an ANOVA test in order to test for the mean differences and to see where the groups differs. Since we calculated 8 tests there is a very high chance that a type-1 error occurred. However, we can conclude that sex is has a significant value since its p-value is much greater then 0.05. An ANOVA test was computed since a Manova test resulted in a statistically significant value. After computing the Anova test for heart disease based on sex, we can conclude that sex is a good predictor of heart disease since the p-value is less then then 0.05 and therefore is statistically significant. After performing an nova test on the variable thalach:maximum heart rate achieved, we can conclude that it is  statistically significant since its p-value is < 0.05. After computers an Anova test on this predictor we can conclude that it is still statistically significant and can be a good predictors of heart disease. 
For Project 2, I also made updates to my Logistic model and bootstrapping. In this model we are using sex, age, and max heart rate in order to predict heart disease
